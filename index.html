  Hi and welcome to my website! I am an <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/staff/mcarbone">assistant computational scientist</a> at <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/world/">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a>'s <a href="https://www.bnl.gov/compsci/">Computational Science Initiative</a>. Previously, I got my PhD in chemical physics from the <a href="https://www.chem.columbia.edu">Chemistry Department at Columbia University</a>, where I was a member of <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/chemistry/groups/reichman/index.html"> David Reichman's group</a>. During this time, I was a <a href="https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/">Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellow</a>, which allowed me to study both data-driven techniques and fundamental condensed matter theory as applied primarily to spectroscopy.

<p>
I live with my wife in Manhattan, and when we're not enjoying the excellent food in New York City, you'll probably find me watching the Yankees, New York Football Giants, F1 racing, or hanging out with our cat, <a href="/cat.html">Lucy</a>.
