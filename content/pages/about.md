My name is Matt Carbone, I am currently an assistant computational scientist at [Brookhaven National Lab](https://www.bnl.gov/world/)'s [Computational Science Initiative](https://www.bnl.gov/compsci/). In my work, I focus in both computational and machine learning methods, as well as fundamental physics, but specifically I am most interested in how to combine the strengths of each to greater effect. I live with my wife in Manhattan, and when we're not enjoying the excellent food in NYC, you'll probably find me watching the Yankees, F1 racing, or hanging out with our cat.
